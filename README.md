# deep_rl_ale
This repo contains an implementation of [this paper](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf) in TensorFlow.  The code runs and learns, but I'm still testing and changing it.  It masters Pong, and does well on breakout, but doesn't score quite as high as the paper yet.
