This repo contains an implementation of [this paper](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf) in TensorFlow.  The code seems to be fully-functional and learns successfully right now, but I've only tested it on Pong so far.  It's very messy right now, but I'll be cleaning it up and adding visualizations/game recordings soon.

Feel free to try to use/play with this code, but you might need to change some of the file paths.  Be warned that the code will be drastically changing in the near future, however.
